## Modding
If you want to attempt to mod this silly thing then feel free to, although it might be kinda hard...

Although I've tried my best to softcode functions and variables, a good chunk of them are hardcoded. So you might want to tinker with the source code a bit.

### Charting songs
You might've noticed an in-game charter... so stop noticing it.

It's ***VERY*** broken!!! And I stopped developing it around Day 3 of the jam because it would simply take too long.

How do you chart songs then? Well, I made a little script that can convert FNF charts into the chart format used by the game. So just plop that in and it *should* work without any additional adjustments. If it doesn't, make an issue and I'll attempt to fix it.
